## Making a smart home using IOT devices

- We made a device that will turn the lights on if the surrounding is dark.
- It has a security feature that will turn led on if some motion is detected.
- It also has the safety feature for detecting fire.
- If the device detects that the temperature goes above 58Â°C then the buzzer will alert with high pitched sounds.

The sensors we used are:
- Ambient Light Sensor [Phototransistor]
- PIR Sensor
- Temperature Sensor [TMP36]
